## SMACSS Base Files - http://smacss.com/book/type-base

> A Base rule is applied to an element using an element selector, a descendent selector, or a child selector, along with any pseudo-classes. It doesnâ€™t include any class or ID selectors. It is defining the default styling for how that element should look in all occurrences on the page.

> - SMACSS, Jonathan Snook

This template includes [`normalize.css`](http://necolas.github.com/normalize.css/) to give consistent base styles for all browsers.
