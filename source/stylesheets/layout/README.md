## SMACSS Layout Files - http://smacss.com/book/type-layout

> CSS, by its very nature, is used to lay elements out on the page. However, there is a distinction between layouts dictating the major and minor components of a page. The minor components—such as a callout, or login form, or a navigation item—sit within the scope of major components such as a header or footer. I refer to the minor components as Modules [...] The major components are referred to as Layout styles.
